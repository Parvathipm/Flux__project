Flux CNN Model for Image Classification
This project demonstrates a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model built using Flux.jl in Julia. The goal is to load a preprocessed image tensor, pass it through a CNN model, and generate a forward pass output.
📜 Project Structure
The project contains the following files:

model.jl → The main Julia script containing the CNN model and forward pass.
preprocessed_image_1.pt → The image tensor saved in PyTorch format.
README.md → Project description and setup instructions.

✅ Requirements
To run this project, you need to install the following Julia packages:

Flux.jl → For building and running the CNN model.
BSON.jl → For loading and saving the image tensor.

💻 Installation
Follow these steps to set up your environment:
Step 1: Install Julia Packages
Open your Julia REPL (terminal) and run the following commands:
juliaCopyusing Pkg
Pkg.add("Flux")
Pkg.add("BSON")
Step 2: Verify the Image Tensor
The preprocessed image tensor (preprocessed_image_1.bson) was originally created in PyTorch and then converted to BSON format for compatibility with Julia.
Ensure the file exists in your directory.
📋 File Descriptions
1. model.jl
This is the main Julia script responsible for:

✅ Loading the preprocessed image tensor (preprocessed_image_1.bson).
✅ Building a simple CNN model using Flux.jl.
✅ Performing a forward pass on the image tensor.
✅ Printing the model's output.

The CNN architecture defined in the script looks like this:
juliaCopyusing Flux
using JLD2
using MLUtils   # ✅ Import MLUtils for flatten function

# Step 1: Load the image tensor from HDF5 file
println("Loading the image tensor...")
data = jldopen("preprocessed_image_1.h5", "r") do file
    read(file, "image_tensor")
end

# Step 2: Reshape the tensor to fit the CNN model
input_data = reshape(data, (28, 28, 3, 1))

# Step 3: Define the CNN Model
println("Creating the CNN model...")
model = Chain(
    Conv((3, 3), 3 => 32, relu),
    MaxPool((2, 2)),
    Conv((3, 3), 32 => 64, relu),
    MaxPool((2, 2)),
    MLUtils.flatten,  # ✅ This is the correct way to flatten now
    Dense(1600, 128, relu),
    Dense(128, 2)
)

# Step 4: Perform a forward pass (prediction)
println("Performing the forward pass...")
output = model(input_data)

# Step 5: Get the prediction
class_index = argmax(output)
if class_index == 1
    println("Prediction: 🌅 Serene Sunset")
else
    println("Prediction: 🏙️ Futuristic City")
end
🚀 How to Run the Project
Follow these steps to run the project:
Step 1: Open Julia REPL
Open your terminal or Julia and navigate to your project folder:
bashCopycd C:/Users/HP/Desktop/Flux project
Step 2: Run the Julia Script
Inside the terminal (Julia REPL), run the script using:
juliaCopyinclude("model.jl")
Step 3: Expected Output
If the model runs successfully, you should see an output like this:
CopyLoading the image tensor...
Creating the CNN model...
Performing the forward pass...
Prediction: 🏙️ Futuristic City
🔮 Future Work
Here are a few ways you can extend this project:

✅ Train the CNN model on a custom dataset.
✅ Implement a classification task using real-world images.
✅ Save and load trained models using BSON.
✅ Convert the model to ONNX or TorchScript.

📝 Final Note
This project is designed as a beginner-level Flux.jl project.
You can extend it by:

✅ Adding more convolution layers.
✅ Training the model using MNIST or CIFAR-10 datasets.
✅ Deploying the model using Pluto.jl or Dash.jl.
